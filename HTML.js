HTML documents follow a specific structure that consists of various elements, each serving a distinct purpose. 
  Here's an overview of the key structural elements in an HTML document, as you've described:

<!DOCTYPE> Declaration:🖇️
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration, short for Document Type Declaration, specifies the version of HTML being used in the document. 
  It helps web browsers understand the document's structure and rendering rules. For example, for HTML5, the declaration is:
<!DOCTYPE html>
  
<html> Element:🖇️
The <html> element serves as the root element of an HTML document and wraps the entire content of the page. It contains two main sections: <head> and <body>.
  
<head> Element:🖇️
The <head> element contains metadata about the document, which is not directly visible to users but provides important information to browsers and search engines. 
  Common elements within <head> include:
<title>: Specifies the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
<meta>: Provides metadata such as character encoding, author information, and keywords.
<link>: Links to external resources like stylesheets (CSS) or web fonts.
<script>: May include JavaScript code or references to external JavaScript files.
Other metadata-related elements and declarations.
Example:
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My Web Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>

<body> Element:🖇️
The <body> element contains the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, forms, and other elements that users interact with. 
  It defines what users see and interact with when they visit the web page.
Example:
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>This is the main content of the web page.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
  </main>
  <footer>
    &copy; 2023 My Website
  </footer>
</body>
This basic structure forms the foundation of an HTML document, allowing you to organize and present content on the web in a structured and standardized manner. 
  The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows developers to create rich and interactive web experiences.

HTML elements and tags are fundamental concepts in web development. They work together to structure and define the content of a web page. 
  Here's a more detailed explanation of these concepts:

HTML Elements:
HTML elements are the basic building blocks of a web page's structure and content.
Each HTML element represents a specific type of content or a structural component on a web page, such as text, images, headings, links, forms, and more.
Elements are enclosed within opening and closing tags, which are usually written using angle brackets (< and >).
Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element or modify its behavior.
  
HTML Tags:
HTML tags are used to define and enclose HTML elements. Tags consist of the element's name enclosed in angle brackets. 
  Tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
The opening tag marks the beginning of an element, while the closing tag marks its end. The closing tag typically includes a 
  forward slash (/) before the element name.
Tags are used to specify the type and purpose of an element. For example, the <p> tag is used to define paragraphs, 
  the <a> tag for links, and the <h1> to <h6> tags for headings.
Examples of HTML elements and their tags:

Paragraph Element:


<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
Anchor Element (Link):


<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
Heading Elements:


<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
Image Element:


<img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
List Elements:


<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
