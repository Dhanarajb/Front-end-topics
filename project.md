#### Introdution
> The project wanted to make a website that had parts anyone could use over and over, like Material UI but with React. Its aim was to create a consistent and flexible system for building things on the front of different apps.

#### Key Features
> The main things were a bunch of flexible web parts made with React, just like Material UI. They made things look and work the same, helping us build different interactive stuff more easily.

#### My Role
>In my role as a front-end developer, I took charge of creating and refining particular web components, prioritizing their responsiveness, compatibility, and seamless integration within our design system. I actively collaborated with both design and back-end teams to ensure a consistent standard and coherence across all components.

#### Challenges
>It's tough to make things both flexible and consistent. We want them to adjust but stay the same in style. Planning and feedback make the design better. It's a bit like jugglingâ€”making different things work together while looking like they match.
