# Build Projects 💡

You’ll not realize, but you’ll learn a ton of things important for Interviews. Here’s what:

# 1️⃣ Core JS

• Closures
• Lexical Scope
• ‘this’ keyword
• Everything’s a Object
• Hoisting - Function, Variables

# 2️⃣ Async JS

• Promises, Callbacks
• Microtask, Callback queue
• Async race conditions
• Event loop, Execution stack

# 3️⃣ DOM JS

• Events - Delegation, Phases
• Complex Element querying
• Rate limiting - Debounce, Throttle
• Network requests race conditions
• Storage - Local, Session

# 4️⃣ Modern JS (used in React)

• Pure functions
• Objects manipulation
• Mutations, Side effects
• Higher order functions
• ES6 - Arrow function, rest, spread,..

# 5️⃣ DSA in JS

(Used in my course project, Google Sheet 2.0)

• Graph Data Structures
• Creating Directed Graph - Nodes, Edges
• Stacks Data Structures
• Infix evaluation Algorithm
• Cycle Detection Algorithm
• DFS for cyclic Path tracing

# 6️⃣ Outcomes of this approach

• Solve Fast
• Hands-on of all concepts
• Projects ready for resume
• Interview ready

# Generally, I have seen there are 4-5 rounds for most product-based companies.

1. Javascript
2. Machine Coding / React
3. DSA
4. System design
5. Managerial Round

Let's decode each of these.

🌲 Javascript (around 45-60min)
👉 html, core concepts of css
👉 DOM APIs & Web APIs
👉 conceptual and fundamental based questions
👉 output, implementation based

🌲 Machine Coding / React (around 60-120min)
In this round you have to build small UI projects like, start rating, carousel etc.

🌲 DSA
👉 Dont ignore DSA as it is a game changer. Try to solve easy to medium level questions, frequently asked and hihly voted questions and you are good to go🚀

🌲 System design
👉 Build architecture for complete application
👉 Accessibility
👉 Cross-browser compatibility
👉 performance
👉 Build size, Api rate limiting ect

🌲 Managerial Round 
 Team fit and behavioral behavioral round.
