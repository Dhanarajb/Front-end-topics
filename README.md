🍄 LRU Cache

🍄 Implement the compose() and pipe() polyfill .

🍄 Design patterns like singleton, factory patterns etc

🍄 Implement the publisher-subscriber pattern in javascript

🍄 Implement the map, filter, reduce, and for Each polyfill

🍄 Implement the Function.bind, call, apply method on the Function Prototype

🍄 Implement Retry API with n number of

🍄 Prototype and prototype inheritance

🍄 How rendering work in the browser

🍄 Event delegation and event propagation in js

# Build Projects 💡

You’ll not realize, but you’ll learn a ton of things important for Interviews. Here’s what:

# 1️⃣ Core JS

• Closures
• Lexical Scope
• ‘this’ keyword
• Everything’s a Object
• Hoisting - Function, Variables

# 2️⃣ Async JS

• Promises, Callbacks
• Microtask, Callback queue
• Async race conditions
• Event loop, Execution stack

# 3️⃣ DOM JS

• Events - Delegation, Phases
• Complex Element querying
• Rate limiting - Debounce, Throttle
• Network requests race conditions
• Storage - Local, Session

# 4️⃣ Modern JS (used in React)

• Pure functions
• Objects manipulation
• Mutations, Side effects
• Higher order functions
• ES6 - Arrow function, rest, spread,..

# 5️⃣ DSA in JS

(Used in my course project, Google Sheet 2.0)

• Graph Data Structures
• Creating Directed Graph - Nodes, Edges
• Stacks Data Structures
• Infix evaluation Algorithm
• Cycle Detection Algorithm
• DFS for cyclic Path tracing

# 6️⃣ Outcomes of this approach

• Solve Fast
• Hands-on of all concepts
• Projects ready for resume
• Interview ready
