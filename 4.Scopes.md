##### Scope
> ***scopes*** refer to the context in which variables and functions are declared and where they are accessible.
```
// Global scope
let globalVar = "I'm in the global scope";

function outerFunction() {
  // Function scope
  let outerVar = "I'm in the outer function";

  function innerFunction() {
    // Function scope
    let innerVar = "I'm in the inner function";

    // Access variables from different scopes
    console.log(globalVar);  // Access the global variable
    console.log(outerVar);   // Access the outer function's variable
    console.log(innerVar);   // Access the inner function's variable
  }

  innerFunction();  // Call the inner function
}

outerFunction();  // Call the outer function

// Attempting to access innerVar outside its scope will result in an error.
// console.log(innerVar); // This will throw an error
```

----
##### Global Scope:
> - Variables and functions declared outside of any function are in the global scope.
> - They are accessible from any part of your JavaScript code.
> - Variables declared without the var, let, or const keyword are automatically in the global scope, which should be avoided to prevent unintended global variable pollution.
----
##### Local Scope (Function Scope):
> - Variables and functions declared within a function are in the local or function scope.
> - They are only accessible within that specific function.
> - Nested functions have access to their parent function's scope, but not the other way around.
Block Scope (ES6+):
---
##### Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), 
> - let and const variables have block scope.
> - Block scope means they are only accessible within the block where they are declared, like within loops or conditional statements.
> - var does not have block scope and is function-scoped.
---
##### Lexical Scope (Closure):
> - The ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope. 
> - Closures are when a function inside another function can still use data from the outer function even after it's done running, like a hidden memory. They're useful for preserving and reusing information.
---
##### Global Object (window in browsers):
> - In the browser environment, the global scope is also accessible through the window object.
> - variables declared in the global scope become properties of the window object.
