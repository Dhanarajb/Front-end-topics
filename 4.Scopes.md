######## ***scopes*** refer to the context in which variables and functions are declared and where they are accessible. Understanding scopes is crucial for working with JavaScript effectively. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of scopes in JavaScript:

Global Scope:

Variables and functions declared outside of any function are in the global scope.
They are accessible from any part of your JavaScript code.
Variables declared without the var, let, or const keyword are automatically in the global scope, which should be avoided to prevent unintended global variable pollution.
Local Scope (Function Scope):

Variables and functions declared within a function are in the local or function scope.
They are only accessible within that specific function.
Nested functions have access to their parent function's scope, but not the other way around.
Block Scope (ES6+):

Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let and const variables have block scope.
Block scope means they are only accessible within the block where they are declared, like within loops or conditional statements.
var does not have block scope and is function-scoped.
Lexical Scope (Closure):

JavaScript uses lexical scope, which means variables are resolved based on their position in the source code, not where the function is called.
Closures occur when a function is defined within another function and retains access to its parent function's scope, even after the parent function has finished executing.
Global Object (window in browsers):

In the browser environment, the global scope is also accessible through the window object.
Variables declared in the global scope become properties of the window object.
Understanding scopes is essential for avoiding variable conflicts, managing the lifecycle of variables, and creating well-organized and maintainable code. It's important to use variables in the appropriate scope and to be aware of how scope affects variable accessibility and lifetime.
