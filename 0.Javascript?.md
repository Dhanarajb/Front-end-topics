### An Introduction to JavaScript

#### What is JavaScript?
> JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive and dynamic. It's primarily responsible for enhancing user experience on web pages.
---
#### Why is it called JavaScript?
> When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: **LiveScript**. But Java was very popular at that time.
JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called **ECMAScript**, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.
The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a **JavaScript virtual machine**.
---
#### Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

> - V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
> - SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
> -  here are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
> For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
---
#### How do engines work?
> Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.
> - The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
> - Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to machine code.
> - And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.
> - The JavaScript engine continuously improves code performance by applying optimizations and adjusting machine code based on how the code runs.

#### What can in-browser JavaScript do?
> - In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
> - For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:
> - Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
> - React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
> - Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
> - Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
> - Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).
---
#### What CAN’T in-browser JavaScript do?
> - JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs.
> - It has no direct access to OS functions.
> - In the browser, JavaScript is restricted for security, and both web pages must agree for data sharing using special code.
> - These rules prevent a page from one website from accessing and stealing data from another.
> - JavaScript can talk to its own server but requires permission to get data from other sites; this doesn't apply outside browsers or with extensions that have extra privileges.
----
#### What makes JavaScript unique?
> There are at least three great things about JavaScript:
> - Full integration with HTML/CSS.
> - Simple things are done simply.
> - Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.

> JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.
> That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.
> That said, JavaScript can be used to create servers, mobile applications, etc.

#### Loading and Parsing
1. HTML Loading: When a web page loads, the browser first fetches the HTML document from the server.
Parsing HTML: The browser parses the HTML document, creating the Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
2. Script Loading
External and Inline Scripts: JavaScript can be included in HTML through <script> tags, either inline or by referencing external files.
Execution Blocking: By default, when the browser encounters a <script> tag, it stops HTML parsing, fetches the script, executes it, and then resumes parsing.
3. Parsing and Compilation
Tokenization: The JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome) breaks the script into tokens.
Parsing: The engine parses these tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Compilation: Modern engines compile JavaScript code to machine code or bytecode to optimize execution.
4. Execution
Global Execution Context: The engine creates a global execution context and starts executing code in the global scope.
Function Execution Context: Each time a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function.
Call Stack: The engine uses a call stack to manage execution contexts. The current context is pushed onto the stack, and once execution finishes, it’s popped off the stack.
5. Event Loop and Asynchronous Operations
Call Stack: Manages synchronous code execution.
Web APIs: Asynchronous operations (like setTimeout, HTTP requests, and DOM events) are handled by browser-provided Web APIs.
Callback Queue: Once asynchronous operations complete, their callbacks are placed in the callback queue.
Event Loop: Continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it pushes the first callback from the queue onto the call stack for execution.
6. Memory Management
Garbage Collection: JavaScript has an automatic garbage collector that frees memory by removing objects that are no longer reachable from the root (global scope).
