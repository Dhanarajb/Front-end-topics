Entry: The entry point is the starting point for Webpack's compilation process. It is typically a JavaScript file that imports other modules.

Loader: Loaders are used to transform assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images. Webpack comes with a variety of built-in loaders, and you can also create your own custom loaders.

Compiler: The compiler is the core of Webpack. It takes the modules and their dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

Bundles: Bundles are the output of Webpack's compilation process. They are typically JavaScript files that contain the compiled code and assets for your application
