# **System Design: Login Flow with SSO**

## **1. Overview**
This system design describes a login flow for a React-based web application using Single Sign-On (SSO) for secure and centralized user authentication. The system consists of three components:  
- **React Frontend (Client)**  
- **Token Management Service (TMS)**  
- **SSO Provider (Authentication Service)**

## **2. Components and Their Roles**

### **React Frontend (Client-Side)**
- **Role**: Entry point for the user.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Captures user credentials (email) and initiates the authentication process.
  - Redirects the user to the TMS for authentication.
  - Handles login state post-authentication by checking authentication cookies.

### **Token Management Service (TMS)**
- **Role**: Mediator between the frontend and the SSO provider.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Redirects users to the SSO provider's login page.
  - Validates tokens received from the SSO provider.
  - Sets a secure session cookie in the browser after successful authentication.
  - Handles error scenarios by redirecting users to appropriate error pages.

### **SSO Provider**
- **Role**: Centralized authentication service (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Authenticates users through credentials or multi-factor authentication.
  - Issues secure tokens after successful authentication.
  - Ensures compatibility with OAuth, SAML, or OpenID Connect standards.

## **3. Step-by-Step Flow**

1. **User Initiates Login**:
   - The user enters their email in the React application and submits the form.
   - The React app generates a URL for the TMS and redirects the browser to it.

2. **TMS Redirects to SSO**:
   - The TMS constructs an authentication request with metadata (e.g., client ID, redirect URI, state) and redirects the user to the SSO login page.

3. **SSO Authenticates the User**:
   - The user logs in with credentials or multi-factor authentication.
   - Upon success, the SSO redirects back to the TMS with a secure token.

4. **TMS Validates the Token**:
   - The TMS validates the token received from the SSO provider.
   - If valid, the TMS sets a secure authentication cookie in the user's browser.

5. **Control Returns to React**:
   - The TMS redirects the user back to the React frontend.
   - The React app detects the cookie, confirms the session, and grants access to the application.

## **4. System Design Considerations**

### **Security**
- Use **HTTPS** for all communication between components.
- Employ **HTTP-only cookies** to prevent XSS attacks.
- Encrypt tokens and set a short expiration time for session cookies.

### **Scalability**
- Design the TMS and SSO provider to handle a high volume of requests.
- Use **load balancers** and **caching mechanisms** for better performance.

### **Session Management**
- Implement **token renewal mechanisms** for a better user experience.
- Set session timeouts and allow manual logout functionality.

### **Error Handling**
- Redirect users to informative error pages for issues like:
  - Token expiration
  - Invalid credentials
  - Network failures

## **5. Real-World Use Case**
This system is similar to how apps like **Slack** or **Google Workspace** handle authentication:
- Once authenticated through the SSO provider, users can seamlessly access multiple applications within the ecosystem without needing to log in repeatedly.

---

## **6. Benefits**
- **Security**: Centralized authentication with SSO ensures secure user identity management.
- **Scalability**: Decoupled design allows each component to scale independently.
- **User Experience**: Seamless login flow reduces friction for end-users.
- **Maintainability**: React remains lightweight, with the TMS and SSO handling authentication logic.
