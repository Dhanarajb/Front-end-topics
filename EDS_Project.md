# Project Overview

## 1. What the Project Was About
The project involved creating a library of reusable components called a design system. This design system provided developers with easy-to-use parts for building applications. The goal was to help developers create apps that looked consistent and professional without starting from scratch each time.

## 2. Why It Was Important
The design system made it faster and easier for developers to build apps by using pre-made components, saving time and effort. It also ensured that all the apps had the same style, which is important for providing a consistent user experience. A uniform look helps users feel comfortable and familiar with the apps.

## 3. What Was Done

### Building Components
Components were designed and built to ensure they were user-friendly and performed well. Optimization was also done to ensure they worked efficiently across different applications.

### Testing and Fixing Issues
Thorough testing was conducted to ensure the components functioned correctly, with any identified issues fixed to enhance reliability.

### Managing the Project
The project was kept on track by managing tasks using Agile methods, collaborating with team members, and utilizing tools like Git for version control and pnpm for managing packages.

## 4. The Result
The design system was successful and adopted by many teams. It made the development process faster and ensured that all the apps had a consistent and polished look, improving the overall user experience.
