# Project Overview

## 1. What the Project Was About
The project focused on creating a library of reusable components known as a design system. This design system provided developers with easy-to-use parts that they could incorporate into their applications. The main goal was to help developers build apps that have a consistent and professional look without having to start from scratch every time they worked on a new project.

## 2. Why It Was Important
The design system was important because it made the development process faster and more efficient. By using ready-made components, developers could save time and effort, allowing them to focus on other important aspects of their applications. Additionally, having a consistent style across all apps is crucial for creating a good user experience. When users see a familiar look and feel, they are more likely to feel comfortable and satisfied with the app.

## 3. What Was Done

### Building Components
The components were carefully designed and built to ensure they were user-friendly and functioned well in various applications. Each component was optimized to make sure it worked efficiently, regardless of how or where it was used.

### Testing and Fixing Issues
A thorough testing process was carried out to check that the components worked correctly. This involved identifying and fixing any problems to ensure that the components were reliable and met quality standards.

### Managing the Project
The project was managed effectively by using Agile methods, which helped keep tasks organized and on schedule. Collaboration with team members was essential to ensure everyone was aligned on goals. Tools like Git were used for version control, allowing for better code management, while pnpm was used for handling project packages smoothly.

## 4. The Result
The design system turned out to be a great success and was adopted by many teams across the organization. It significantly sped up the development process, allowing teams to deliver their applications more quickly. Moreover, the design system ensured that all the apps had a consistent and polished look, which greatly improved the overall experience for users.
