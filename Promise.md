### Promise

>Promises are a way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. When you create a promise, you are essentially saying that you will eventually provide the result of the asynchronous operation. The promise object has two methods: then() and catch(). The then() method is used to specify the code that should be run when the promise is resolved, and the catch() method is used to specify the code that should be run when the promise is rejected.
