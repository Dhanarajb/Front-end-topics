### Promise

>Promises are a way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. When you create a promise, you are essentially saying that you will eventually provide the result of the asynchronous operation. The promise object has two methods: then() and catch(). The then() method is used to specify the code that should be run when the promise is resolved, and the catch() method is used to specify the code that should be run when the promise is rejected.

### Async/await

>Async/await is a pair of keywords that simplify asynchronous programming by making it look more like synchronous programming. The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous, and the await keyword is used to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing.
