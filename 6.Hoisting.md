### Hoisting
> Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved (or "hoisted") to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
------------------------------------------------------

#### Variable Declarations:🖇️
> When you use "var" to declare a variable, its declaration is moved to the top, but the value is assigned in its original spot. So you can use it before declaring, but it'll be undefined until given a value.

Example:
```
console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
var x = 5;
The variable x is hoisted to the top, so the console.log statement does not result in an error, but it logs undefined.
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Function Declarations:🖇️
> Function declarations are moved to the top, allowing you to use and call a function before actually defining it in your code.

Example:
```
foo(); // This works even though foo is declared later in the code
function foo() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
The function foo is hoisted, so it can be called before its actual declaration in the code.
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Variable Scope:🖇️
> Variables declared with var are function-scoped. If a variable is declared inside a function, it's only accessible within that function.
```
function example() {
  var localVar = "I'm local!";
  console.log(localVar);
}
example(); // "I'm local!"
console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Function Expressions:🖇️
> Function expressions are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations. Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function itself.
```
sayHello(); // Error: sayHello is not a function
var sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
In this case, sayHello is hoisted as a variable, but it's not a function until the assignment is made.
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ):🖇️
> "let" and "const" variables have a temporal dead zone where they exist but can't be used before they're declared, encouraging cleaner and safer code practices.
```
console.log(myVar); // Error: Cannot access 'myVar' before initialization
let myVar = 10;
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Hoisting Order:🖇️
> Understanding the order in which variables and functions are hoisted can be crucial. Functions are hoisted before variables, and declarations are hoisted before assignments.
```
var x = 5;
function x() {}
console.log(x); // 5
```
> Function declarations are hoisted first, which means you can call a function before declaring it in your code.
> Variable declarations (using var) are also hoisted, but they are initialized with the value undefined by default.
> Assignments to variables are not hoisted, so if you assign a value to a variable after its declaration, it will only take effect where it's assigned.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Arrow Functions:🖇️
> Arrow functions do not have their own this context, but they are not hoisted in the same way as regular functions.
```
console.log(sayHello); // undefined
var sayHello = () => console.log("Hello!");
```
> Understanding hoisting at the expert level involves dealing with nuances like the TDZ, order of hoisting, and the differences between var, let, const, and 
  arrow functions. This knowledge helps you write clean and predictable JavaScript code.

#### The difference between **variable declaration** and ***variable initialization**🖇️
> **Variable declaration** is like naming a container, while variable initialization is like putting something inside that container. Declaration creates the variable,

Example:
```
var x; // Variable declaration
let y; // Variable declaration
const z = 10; // Variable declaration and initialization
```
> **Variable Initialization**:  initialization assigns it a value.

Example:
```
var x; // Variable declaration
x = 5; // Variable initialization
let y = 20; // Variable declaration and initialization
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Hoisting with var Declarations:
> When you declare a variable using var, the declaration is hoisted to the top of its containing function or global scope during the compilation phase. 
  This means that the variable name becomes known within the scope, even if the actual declaration appears later in the code. However, only the 
  declaration is moved to the top, not the assignment.

Example:
```
console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
var x = 5; // Variable declaration and initialization
```
---
#### TDZ - 
> Time between declaration and initialization of let and const variables.
> We are trying to access the variable which has been not declared or initialized yet.
The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept in JavaScript that refers to the period when a variable is in scope but cannot be accessed before its declaration due to hoisting.
 
the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript in simple terms:

> The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept in JavaScript related to the **scope** and **hoisting** of variables declared using the let and const keywords. 
   It's a period in code execution where you cannot access a variable before it's declared in its current scope.

> Here's a scenario to help you understand the Temporal Dead Zone:

Scenario: Declaring and Accessing a Variable with let

```
console.log(myVar); // Throws a ReferenceError

if (true) {
  // TDZ starts here
  console.log(myVar); // Throws a ReferenceError

  let myVar = 42; // Variable declaration in this scope
  // TDZ ends here

  console.log(myVar); // Outputs 42
}

console.log(myVar); // Throws a ReferenceError
```
> In this scenario:
> - The first ```console.log(myVar)``` statement outside the if block throws an error because myVar is not defined yet. It's in the Temporal Dead Zone.
> - Inside the if block, another ```console.log(myVar)``` statement is encountered before the ```let myVar = 42;``` declaration. This also throws an error because myVar is still in the Temporal Dead Zone within that block.
> - The ```let myVar = 42;``` declaration brings myVar out of the Temporal Dead Zone, and you can access it.
> - The subsequent ```console.log(myVar)``` within the same block correctly outputs ```42``` because myVar is now accessible.
> - Outside the if block, the final ```console.log(myVar)``` statement throws an error again because myVar is out of scope.
