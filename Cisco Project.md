# DNA Spaces Project

**DNA Spaces** is a platform designed to optimize room occupancy and seating arrangements through a dynamic dashboard system. It supports various use cases, including:

- Manufacturing
- Retail
- Education
- Healthcare
- Workspaces
- Hospitality

The system provides real-time occupancy monitoring and route-based analytics to enhance space utilization. My role involved developing features for effective space management and customizable dashboards tailored to different industry needs. This project aimed to improve operational efficiency and user experience across diverse environments.

## Technology

We used **React** for the front end due to its component-based architecture, which made it easier to build a responsive UI.
