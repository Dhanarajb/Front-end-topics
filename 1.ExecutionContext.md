- In the container the first component is **memory component** and the 2nd one is **code component**

- Memory component has all the variables and functions in key value pairs. It is also called **Variable environment**.

- Code component is the place where code is executed one line at a time. It is also called the **Thread of Execution**.

- JS is a **synchronous**, **single-threaded** language
  - Synchronous:- In a specific synchronous order.
  - Single-threaded:- One command at a time.
