> REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs serve as a means for communication between different software systems over the web.

> To interact with a REST API, I use HTTP methods such as GET to retrieve data, POST to create new resources, PUT to update existing ones, and DELETE to remove them.

> After making a request, I typically handle the response by parsing JSON data using methods like response.json(). Additionally, I implement error handling to manage potential issues during the reques

> In React applications, I use state management tools like useState and useEffect to manage API data. This ensures that the UI reflects the most up-to-date information from the server.

> Before integrating an API, I thoroughly review its documentation to understand endpoints, request formats, and response structures. Testing, both unit and integration, is crucial to ensure the reliability of API integrations.
