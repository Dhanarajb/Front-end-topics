# User Management Flow in Dashboard

## 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- **Login**: Users must log in using their credentials (e.g., username and password) or through Single Sign-On (SSO).
- **Role Assignment**: After login, the system checks the user's role (e.g., Admin, Moderator, Viewer) to determine their access level.

## 2. User List View
- **Display User List**: The dashboard displays a list of all users, including their names, roles, statuses, and other relevant details.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search or filter the list based on criteria like role, status, or other attributes.

## 3. Adding a New User
- **Open Add User Form**: Clicking the "Add User" button opens a form where the admin can enter user details like name, email, role, etc.
- **Invite or Create**: The admin can choose to send an invitation email to the new user or create the user directly in the system.
- **Assign Roles & Permissions**: Assign the appropriate role and permissions to the new user.
- **Save**: Once the details are filled in, the user is created, and an email (if applicable) is sent to the new user.

## 4. Editing an Existing User
- **Select User**: From the user list, the admin selects a user to edit.
- **Open Edit User Form**: Clicking the "Edit" button opens a form pre-populated with the user's current information.
- **Update Details**: The admin can update user details, change roles, or modify permissions.
- **Save Changes**: Once updated, the changes are saved, and the userâ€™s information is updated in the system.

## 5. Deleting a User
- **Select User**: From the user list, the admin selects a user to delete.
- **Confirmation**: A confirmation dialog prompts the admin to confirm the deletion.
- **Delete User**: Upon confirmation, the user is removed from the system. Depending on the system, this might be a soft delete (deactivated user) or a hard delete (permanent removal).

## 6. Managing User Roles & Permissions
- **View Roles & Permissions**: The admin can view existing roles and the permissions associated with each role.
- **Create or Edit Roles**: The admin can create new roles or edit existing ones, assigning specific permissions (e.g., read, write, delete) for various modules.
- **Assign Roles**: The roles can then be assigned to users to define their access level within the dashboard.

## 7. Monitoring User Activity
- **Activity Logs**: The dashboard may include logs that track user activities like login times, changes made, and actions performed.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: The system may send alerts or notifications for specific user actions (e.g., failed login attempts, role changes).

## 8. User Profile Management
- **User Profiles**: Users can access their profiles to view and update personal information like name, contact details, password, etc.
- **Password Reset**: Users can reset their passwords through the profile section, often requiring current password validation or a confirmation link sent to their email.

## 9. Bulk Actions (Optional)
- **Bulk User Operations**: The dashboard may offer bulk actions like bulk delete, bulk role assignment, or bulk user import/export.

## 10. Audit & Compliance (Optional)
- **Audit Logs**: The dashboard may keep detailed logs of all user management activities for audit and compliance purposes.
- **Compliance Checks**: The system may periodically check and enforce compliance with organizational policies related to user management.
