# How I Used Node.js in Edison Design System 2.0

In the development of **Edison Design System 2.0**, while the primary focus was on **React** and **styled-components**, **Node.js** played a crucial role in various areas to support development, automation, and integration.

## 1. Build and Bundling  
- Used **Node.js** to configure **Webpack** and **Babel** for bundling and transpiling modern JavaScript (ES6+), ensuring cross-browser compatibility.  
- Optimized assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images to enhance performance.

## 2. Automated Testing  
- Integrated **Jest** and **Mocha**, both **Node.js-based testing frameworks**, to ensure all UI components were unit-tested.  
- Used **Storybook** (which runs on Node.js) to test and develop components in isolation.

## 3. Development and Documentation  
- **Storybook** was used to create an interactive UI library, making it easier for developers and designers to visualize components.  
- **Node.js-powered documentation tools** helped in generating and serving component documentation dynamically.

## 4. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)  
- Automated build, test, and deployment processes using **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions**, which relied on Node.js scripts.  
- Ensured seamless deployment of the design system with minimal manual intervention.

## 5. API Integration for Design Tokens  
- Developed a **Node.js-based API** to serve **design tokens** (e.g., colors, typography, spacing) dynamically.  
- Allowed teams to fetch and integrate standardized design tokens across multiple applications.

## 6. Versioning and Package Management  
- Automated **versioning and changelog generation** using Node.js.  
- Published the design system as an **npm package**, ensuring easy distribution and integration across different teams.

## Conclusion  
Node.js was a key enabler in **streamlining development, automating workflows, and maintaining consistency** across applications. It provided the necessary infrastructure for **build automation, testing, documentation, API integration, and CI/CD**, making the design system **scalable and easy to adopt** across teams.
