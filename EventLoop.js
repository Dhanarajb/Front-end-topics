1. What is an event loop in programming?
Answer: An event loop is a mechanism that manages the execution of asynchronous tasks in a single-threaded environment. 
It continuously checks for pending tasks or events and executes associated callbacks to ensure efficient task handling.

2. How does an event loop enable non-blocking behavior?
Answer: An event loop enables non-blocking behavior by allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting 
for asynchronous operations, such as I/O or timers, to complete. This prevents the main thread from being blocked.

3. What is the difference between microtasks and macrotasks in an event loop?
Answer: Microtasks are high-priority tasks that are executed before the event loop moves on to processing macrotasks. 
They usually include promises and other tasks with immediate responses. Macrotasks, on the other hand, are lower-priority 
tasks like I/O operations and timers.

4. How does an event loop handle callback functions?
Answer: Callback functions are registered with the event loop and associated with specific events or asynchronous operations. 
When the relevant event or operation is complete, the event loop executes the corresponding callback, allowing the program to respond to the event.

5. Explain the concept of the "call stack" in relation to an event loop.
Answer: The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls during the program's execution. 
In an event loop, the call stack represents the current execution context. Asynchronous tasks and callbacks are 
pushed onto the call stack when executed.

6. How does an event loop manage concurrency in a single-threaded environment?
Answer: While an event loop doesn't provide true parallelism, it simulates concurrency by interleaving the execution of tasks. 
Asynchronous tasks are processed in an order that maximizes the utilization of the available thread, resulting in the illusion of 
concurrent execution.

7. What is the purpose of the "setTimeout" function in JavaScript's event loop?
Answer: The "setTimeout" function schedules the execution of a callback function after a specified delay. It adds a macrotask to 
the event queue, and when the delay is reached, the event loop will execute the callback.

8. How does error handling work within an event loop?
Answer: Errors in callback functions can be handled using try-catch blocks within those callbacks. Additionally, 
it's important to attach an error event handler to the event loop itself to capture unhandled errors and prevent them 
from crashing the application.

9. Why might an event loop-based architecture be preferred for certain applications?
Answer: Event loop-based architectures are well-suited for applications that require responsiveness and handle multiple 
asynchronous operations, such as user interfaces, network servers, and real-time applications. They ensure smooth execution 
without blocking the main thread.

10. What challenges can arise from working with event loops, and how can they be mitigated?
Answer: Callback hell or deeply nested callbacks can make code hard to read and maintain. This can be mitigated by using 
async/await syntax or by breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable functions. Additionally, proper error handling and 
testing are crucial to avoid unexpected behavior.
